# XMLParser
There were implemented such design pattern as Singleton, Factory, Service locator and Repository. 
- Used Singleton to create an only instance of the ServiceLocator class and use it in the whole program
- Factory was used to create DOM or SAX class instances
- Service locator was used to return the service instances on demand (parser in my program)
- Repository was used to include CRUD operations with parsed from XML file data

I've also used JDBC for working with MySQL and manipulate data using it.
